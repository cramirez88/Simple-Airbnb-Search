# Simplified Airbnb Search

The basis of this project is to present a simplified search form that returns a list of Airbnb stays that can then be shared will multiple recipients via text and/or email. 
The search form will be initially displayed with three filters: Location, date range, and # of guests.
An expandable view of the search form can contain additional filters such as: # beds, # bedrooms, budget, # of bathrooms, etc.
User authentication/authorization will be implemented to tailor user experience (history log)
